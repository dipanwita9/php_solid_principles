## üßê Why Use SOLID Principles <a name = "whySOLID"></a>

To create maintainable systems of Object Oriented Design SOLID principles should be referred. Following these principles will allow systems to be created which are robust, extensible and maintainable.

## üèÅ What are the SOLID Principles <a name = "whatSOLID"></a>

SOLID is the acronym that stands for 
- Single Responsibility principle
- Open-Closed principle
- Liskov Substitution principle
- Interface Segregation principle
- Dependency Inversion principle


## Single Responsibility principle <a name = "srp"></a>

*Every method should do one thing. Every class should represent one thing.</br>
A class should only have one reason to change, which means it should only have one responsibility.*</br>
If you have a method inside an object that does too many things without invoking outside methods that method is doing too much and runs the risk of becoming an anti-pattern known as the *god function* which violates SRP.

## Open-Closed principle <a name="ocp"></a>

*Software entities(ex: Class, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.*</br>
Class can extend its behavior without modifying it. 

## Liskov Substitution principle <a name="lsp"></a>

*Any object of a subtype should be suitable and working substitute for its superclass. This relies on inheritance more than anything else. This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior.* </br>
In 1988, American computer scientist Barbara Liskov delivered a keynote speech at a conference called Data Abstraction and Hierarchy, wherein she introduced this principle.


## Interface Segregation principle <a name="isp"></a>

*No class should be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use, nor should it depend on a method it doesn't use.*</br>
A client should only know the methods they are going to use and not those that they are not going to use.

## Dependency Inversion principle <a name="dip"></a>

*High level classes should not depend on low level classes and both should depend on abstractions</br>
Abstractions should not depend on implementation details but instead details should depend upon abstractions.*<br>
This principle allows for more flexible and decoupled code, making it easier to change implementations without affecting other parts of the codebase.
